# Overview

AI Resume Analyzer is a modular resume analysis platform designed to help students and job seekers evaluate their resumes against industry expectations.

The system automatically extracts resume content from PDF files, identifies technical skills, estimates experience level, evaluates resume quality, measures semantic similarity with target job roles, and recommends improvements based on missing skills.

Unlike traditional keyword matching systems, this project utilizes Sentence Transformers to perform semantic comparison between resumes and predefined job role descriptions, enabling more meaningful and context-aware matching.

The application also includes administrative analytics for resume insights, clustering, similarity search, and user feedback management through MongoDB.

# Resume Analysis Workflow

Once a resume is uploaded, the application performs the following tasks automatically:

* Extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
* Parses resume content into structured information.
* Detects technical skills.
* Estimates experience level.
* Computes a Resume Score.
* Displays a detailed score breakdown.
* Allows users to select a target job role.
* Computes semantic similarity between the resume and target role.
* Calculates a Job Match Score.
* Identifies missing skills.
* Recommends courses and certifications.
* Suggests interview preparation resources.
* Stores analytics for administrative insights (if MongoDB is configured).

---

# Machine Learning & NLP Techniques Used

The project integrates several AI and NLP techniques:

### Sentence Transformers

Generates dense semantic embeddings for resumes and job-role descriptions.

### Cosine Similarity

Measures semantic similarity between resume embeddings and target role embeddings.

### Skill Extraction

Dictionary-based extraction combined with normalization and alias mapping.

### Resume Scoring

Explainable rule-based scoring instead of a black-box model, providing transparency in evaluation.

### Resume Clustering

Uses K-Means clustering to group resumes with similar characteristics for administrative analysis.

---

# Database Design

MongoDB is used for persistent storage.

The system maintains separate collections for:

* Resume Information
* Analytics Records
* Feedback
* Contact Messages

Resume records are deduplicated using semantic hashing, while analytics are stored as event-based records to support historical analysis without data duplication.

---

# Current Project Status

# Future Enhancements

* ATS Compatibility Score
* Resume vs Job Description Comparison
* AI-powered Resume Improvement Suggestions
* Automatic Resume Rewriting
* Cover Letter Generation
* Cloud Deployment with MongoDB Atlas
* User Authentication
* Email-based Report Generation
* Downloadable Resume Analysis Report (PDF)
* Dashboard Analytics using Power BI or Tableau

---

# Notes

* Python 3.11 is recommended for compatibility with the NLP libraries.
* MongoDB is required only for Feedback, Contact, Analytics, and Admin modules.
* Core Resume Analysis features work independently.
* The first execution may take additional time because Sentence Transformers downloads the pretrained embedding model automatically.
